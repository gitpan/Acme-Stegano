=head1 NAME

Acme::Stegano - Put some text inside another

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::Stegano;

  # Create a stegano object passing a file you wish to inject

  my $st = Stegano->new("my-file.txt");
  $st->insert("This is a sample text");

  # nearby in some other part of code, someone could
  my $st = Stegano->new("my-file.txt");
  print $st->extract

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can put some text inside another and it seems to remain the same.
Then you could extract the text doing the inverse operation. The idea was from
Damian Cownay in his Acme::Bleach.

=head1 SPECIAL THANKS

Well, this is based in the idea of Damian Conway used in Acme::Bleach, so thank it to him.
